# Status

--|---|---
Joker | Golden Retriever | Debugging
Joker | Akuma Themed Card | Approved, ready
Joker | Fickle Fox | Approved
Joker | Fickle Fox Follow Up | Planning
Joker | Power Up First Card | Planning

Joker | Kyuubi Themed | Planning

Fully Fleshed out cards are at the bottom of the list.  Concepts are at the top.

# Approved Cards

These are being built or are a complete idea and ready to be built.

## Golden Retriever
Design: A golden retriever dog in Balatro-style with two tennis balls in its mouth.

Effect:
When a gold card is played, one in three chance of a copy of it being added to your deck.
Should say "Good boy!' when this happens

~~If a gold card returns, it increases in value before being played again.~~

✅ - Card Art Finalized

✅ - Card Appears in Joker List

✅ - Card Functions

❌ - Card Completed

Troubleshooting
* Need to fix message
* card procs too much 
* should the new cards appear in your hand or in the deck, like the stone card?
* Odds should be higher, if we are retriggering, the 'good boy' bonus should be lower, like the +mult from luckies

## Heaven's Gate - Raging Demon Card

Card Design ideas: 
* Features the Japanese kanji for "Heaven" (天), pronounced "ten".
* Akuma looking joker
* Backwards facing fighter with kanji for heaven
* Backwards facing fighter with katakana for 'joker' 

Effect: When a 10 is played, grants +15 chips and a random buff.
Special Mechanic: Has a chance to count twice, similar to the Blood mechanic.

## Fickle Fox 

- Fickle Fox
- - Applies gold seal to last played hand of cards all played cards? First played hand?
- - Could be Golden Fox Effigy
- One is six chance to vanish

# Concept Phase Cards

These cards are all presently just a base idea that should be fleshed out more.  

### To Go Even Further Beyond
Design: A Joker card featuring an anime-style transformation with spiky black hair (base form) and spiky blonde hair with glowing green eyes (powered-up form) in retro pixel art.
Effect: When played as the first hand, it increases the power level of a card by +1.

Need better themeing ideas for this card

### Concepts 

These cards all need some more work in the areas of theming and affects

Clone Card → Creates one copy of itself and increases the copy’s power level by +1.

Beautiful Fox → Interacts specifically with cards numbered 7.

Ethereal Nine-Tailed Fox → Interacts specifically with cards numbered 9.

Undertow → Replaces a played single card with a number 8 card.

Squidlord → Eights become lucky & wild, and hit twice.

Enfeeble Tarot → Decreases the power of up to two cards (i.e. 2 becomes Ace, Ace becomes King)

Lesser Summoning Circle Tarot → Applies tag, like 'Uncommon free joker in shop' 

Greater Summoning Circle Tarot → Applies tag, like 'Rare free joker in shop' 


### Additional todo 

* Come up with overall mod name
* setup standalone github project
* enable issues
* create Releases pipeline for ease of use


* * Workshop some Ideas for long term viability, i.e. most of the power in decks comes from same-same builds like Mime and Baron
- Mime - retrigger all cards in hand
- Baron - steel like trigger for all kings held in hand
- Planetary cards apply steel like mult
- Dusk - retrigger all cards on final hand

Ideas -

Orbital Bombardment 
- Blue seal cards apply an extra affect Joker, maybe we can name after a famous original astronomer?
- Gold seal card affect joker?  Midas?  Gold seal cards add mult = to held dollars in hand

- Fickle Fox
- - Applies gold seal to last played hand of cards?  First played hand?
- - Could be Golden Fox Effigy
- One is six chance to vanish

- - Benevolant Fox God
- Follow up Joker, similar to Gros Michel and Cavendish, once fleet fox vanshes
- Gold Seal cards apply 1.5x mult
