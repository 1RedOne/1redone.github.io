# Programmed Cards

 These cards are fully working and are ready to have concept art replaced by pixel art to whoever woudl like to do them

 What the sections mean:
 * Card name - My idea for a name for the card, open to suggestion if you have a good idea :)
 * Core Concept - what I've programmed the card to do
 * Design - my first stab for for how this card should look


## Golden Repeater
Core Concept - repeat and small chance to gain extra cards when golden cards played.  Like a dog that fetches and comes back with two balls

Design: A golden retriever dog in Balatro-style with two tennis balls in its mouth.



Effect:
- When a gold card is played, one in three chance of a copy of it being added to your deck.
- Gold cards are counted twice

## Lucky Retriever
Core Concept - repeat and small chance to gain extra cards when Lucky cards played.  LIke a dog that fetches and comes back with two balls

Design: An irish setter or other similar dog in Balatro-style with two tennis balls in its mouth and luck based iconography



Effect:
When a lucky card is played, one in three chance of a copy of it being added to your deck.  Can retrigger lucky cards


## Fickle Fox 
Core Concept - may grant golden seal to played cards, can be lucky and get additional procs before vanishes.  Might vanish at any time.

Design - a fox quizzically looking at a Fox statue in a shrine, like the Kyoto Fox Shrine complex Fushimi Inari, where people pay tribute to the fickle fox spirit who may bless their business ventures.

Effect
- Fickle Fox
- - Applies gold seal to played cards randomly
- - places up to six then vanishes 
- One in six chance to vanish at the end of the round

Art Concepts




## Fickle Fox Follow Up - Benevolance

Design - some form of ethereal fox spirit presence, possibly in a temple.  Could give off 'Ashura' or other cosmis deity vibes

Effect
Reward the accrual of Gold Seal Cards
- Follow up Joker, only available after fickly fox vanishes
- Gold Seal cards apply 1.5x mult when kept in hand (kind of an inverse of the normal benefit of playing gold seals)
- really goes wild when a gold seal is on a steel card

Concept art - unused



Finalized art



## A Kuma


Core Concept - a nod to a famous fighter. We can make a play on words about him being a bear, because his name could be misread as 'A kuma', and kuma means bear.

* Features the Japanese kanji for "Heaven" (天), pronounced "ten".
* Backwards facing fighter with kanji for heaven
* Backwards facing fighter with katakana for 'joker' 

Effect: When a 10 is played, gains +2 chips
 - if all cards in hand are tens, applies +15 mult


## Felicette


Core Concept - The first cat in space

Concept - a cat in or on a rocket ship?

## Lord of Gold

Core Concept - not fitting in the overall theme but the idea is to nod to a famous Lord of Gold from a popular trading card game.  He will grant xMult for gold cards.  He will be a Rare card.

Concept - pixel art representation of Eldlich the golden lord in his famous reclining pose.  Already made a custom frame for this one.

## Hachiko

Core Concept - He should play just like walkie-talkie but for 8's and 5's, a play on his name Hachi = Eight, Ko - would be Go (which is 5) but applying the " modifier as a pun.   Goes very nicely with Fibonacci.

Design -    A nod to the famous dog with a statue in Tokyo.  I don't remember there being cherry trees near him but its not far from the area, so we can take artistic license here like in my concept card.


## Sonar Bat

Core Concept - Just for newbies, it's a bat that shows the next card in your hand.

Design - I pictured a mom rat using sonar and the baby covering its ears.  I spent a long time working on the ears qq


## Sun and Moon (Open to better naming)

Core Concept - This card rewards played 6's and 9's in a similar manner to walkie-talkie.  Goes nicely with odd Todd.

Design - Open to interpretation but the idea was a Hemingway cat (six toes) with a cute Kyuubi (a nine tailed fox).  I remember the area where I saw Hemingway's cats looking like it had French Quarter vibes so I put them in the french quarter in my first stab at it.

## Bandit Loach

Core Concept - An alternate take on Spaceman.  He *always* upgrades the first played hand per round but charges you $2.  Then after that he might upgrade any played hand for free but with worse odds than spaceman.

Design - I pictured a cute little loach in the kind of sand caves they make.  They're the cutest little fish, I used to have a tank full of them. 

## Holowing Owl

Core Concept - I always loved hologram cards as a collector as a kid.  I think they need more love.  This will retrigger each hologram card so it goes great with an xMult joker.  I thought it would be fun to have a low proc rate to grant hologram to another played card if the played hand includes at least one.  Like 'contagious holograms'

Design - A snowy owl with lisa frank like holograms infront of a moon with a 'moondog', one of those ice rings around a full moon you see sometimes.

## Enfeeble

Core Concept - The opposite of a Strength card

Design - For some reason a little yowling kitten seemed right for this one.  

## Meteor Shower

Core Concept - This spectral card is like aura, but applies to your whole hand of cards in the Shop.  However, it also has a Wheel of Fortune like chance to do nothing.

Design - to keep with the animal theme, a cat or other animal looking through a telescope and the sky is full of meteros or shooting stars

## Polymerization

Core Concept - A risk reward spectral.  This might apply Glass, Steel or Gold to any hand in your whole hand in the shop, like Meteor Shower.  It might also destroy a single card too.

Design - Totally open to interpetation, I did a bad job recreating the art from the card game for this one.

## Maximum Holofoil

Core Concept - An expensive an rare booster with guaranteed holofoil cards inside.  Implemented for Jokers only but thought about doing this for playing cards too.

Design - A nod to the Yugioh  "Maximum Gold' series of booster packs with an eye catching holofoily design.  Totally open to interpretation


## Maximum Negation

Core Concept - An expensive ($15 or maybe $20) and rare booster with guaranteed NEGATIVE cards inside.  

Design - A nod to the Yugioh  "Maximum Gold' series of booster packs with an eye catching negative palette design.  Totally open to interpretation


## Maximum Negation

Core Concept - Buying it gives you a negative four fingered joker one time

Design - I just think it's neat

# Concepts 

These cards all need some more work in the areas of theming and affects


### To Go Even Further Beyond
Design: A Joker card featuring an anime-style transformation with spiky black hair (base form) and spiky blonde hair with glowing green eyes (powered-up form) in retro pixel art.
Effect: When single or pair card played as the first hand, it increases the power level of both cards by +1.

## Divine Feline 
Plays with 7's and 9's

## Holoblessing

Interacts especially with holographic cards

## Rare Arcane

Applies Holo two two cards

Clone Card → Creates one copy of itself and increases the copy’s power level by +1.

Undertow → Replaces a played single card with a number 8 card.

Squidlord → Eights become lucky & wild, and hit twice.

Seven's themed joker ideas 
* Cat sith themed lucky 7's joker that refires 7's
* Follow up joker which adds +chips when 7's are scored

### Additional todo 

* Come up with overall mod name
* setup standalone github project
* enable issues
* create Releases pipeline for ease of use

## End Game Fun Improvements
I want to workshop some Ideas for long term viability, i.e. most of the power in decks comes from same-same builds like Mime and Baron

### Sources of end game viabulity today
- Mime - retrigger all cards in hand
- Baron - steel like trigger for all kings held in hand
- Planetary cards apply steel like mult with certain legendary
- Dusk - retrigger all cards on final hand

### Ideas
- I'd like a one/two joker setup in my mod.  One applied a buff to a card but is ephemeral
- another low probability card rewards the buff.  Players could have fun using Death and the copy card spectral to make more, or use deck thinning.  Thought is that maybe we increase the xMult per card played with buff, OR when a card with buff is played, increase Joker xMult.  

## General Card Concepts

### Orbital Bombardment 
- Blue seal cards apply an extra affect Joker, maybe we can name after a famous original astronomer?
- Gold seal card affect joker?  Midas?  Gold seal cards add mult = to held dollars in hand

### Fickle Fox
- - Applies gold seal to last played hand of cards?  First played hand?
- - Could be Golden Fox Effigy
- One is six chance to vanish


### Benevolant Fox God
- Follow up Joker, similar to Gros Michel and Cavendish, once fleet fox vanshes
- Gold Seal cards apply 1.5x mult
- need to implement some kind of depletion, or it's basically like turning an entire deck into quasi-glass

### Bandit loach / Racoon concepot
- - Increases level of played hand once per round.  Eats 30 chips as payment

### Space Cat / Souyuz idea 
- - Starts at $3.  Adds + chips to each card played.  Gone after six hands

### Sonar Bat
- - Reveals next card in deck

### Fickle Fennec
* Elemental joker which changes alignment from red/black.  If only cards of alignment are played, xMult upgrades once per round.  But resets if wrong alignment played.

### Reward 7's and 9's

good synergy with odd card

### Add mult when straights or flushes played
Card

### Flying Feret
* Blesses up to five played cards with a blue seal

### Eminence
* xmult for gold cards held in hand, not scored (inverse of gold cards to reward saving)

Something

Radiance

Image pixel size Image size should be 71 x 95
