In a conversation on Twitter, I lamented with some friends that Hitting Windows+X in Windows 8 and above opens up the admin window, but still--In 2014--lists Command Prompt as the CLI.

![PowerShellWPowerShell](../assets/images/2014/11/images/powershellwpowershell.png) Maybe in Windows Vista this would have made sense...but PowerShell had already been out for SIX YEARS when Windows 8 shipped.

With one single line of PowerShell, we can right this grieveous wrong.

```powershell 
 Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced \` -Name "DontUsePowerShellOnWinX" -Value 0 
```
