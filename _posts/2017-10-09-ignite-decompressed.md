Ignite Orlando WAS AWESOME! In this post, I'll give you some of my fun memories and commentary about the event, and then end with a bunch of the best videos from Microsoft Ignite 2017.

### My sessions

We had a HUGE turn out for the PowerShell Community Event, in fact, it was so big that we had an overflow room with 200 people in it!

There were a lot of folks waiting outside who weren't able to attend, and at this point Adam Bertram and Simon Whalin were the REAL MVPs.¬† They left the room and lead an impromptu session to get the discussion going in the overflow room.

Not pictured, Adam Bertram standing on a table, shouting into the crowd!¬† Oh, and did I mention that Jeffrey Snover came on stage as well?¬† Talk about a dream come true!

Fortunately I was prepared and stammered through a terrible soft-ball question about Azure Cloud Shell.¬† Jeffrey said 'that's your question, Stephen?'

My final session was at the end of the day on Thursday, which effectively maximized my stress for the entirety of Ignite.¬† Fortunately I had plenty of time to practice and work on my transitions and I felt that I really gave it my all.

Next year, I'd like to lead a one hour session, or one focused on real world usage of PowerShell as a glue language.¬† We'll see if they get approved!

Don and Jeffrey filled a colossal 5300 person auditorium to capacity, in their PowerShell Unplugged session.

Even these two unflappable speakers looked a tiny bit overwhelmed (just for a moment) by the colossal turnout!

Brad Anderson continued his 'Lunchbreak With Brad series', but this time opened it up to everyone at Ignite!¬† I joined and was actually featured in the video (around the 9 min mark)

Getting to meet Brad in person was great, as I've seen him deliver presentations so many times in person and virtually!¬† I would have liked to have had a full lunch break with him!

## My Top Ten Must Watch Sessions

I love the trend of recording all of the bigger sessions.¬† Here are some of my favorite (which happened to be recorded).

The keynote was...interesting, but ended with an odd deep dive on Quantum computing, which was a bit odd.¬† I could have done with more explanation on what MSFT365 is...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_aphl0s4WTs

Fortunately, Brad Anderson explained that here in this session.¬† Microsoft 365 is essentially a new tier of Office 365 license which now includes Intune, Advanced Threat Protection, and all the O365 goodness we already had.¬† I¬†_believe_ it includes pricing for Windows Licensing as well.

Azure Automation session with Joey Aiello, Hemant and Aemon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOiwcN6DAwQ

Donovan Devops in any language, with Damian Brady and Donovan Brown.¬† A dynamic and exciting session talking through VSTS's devops capabilities.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE6Pb5lOf9M

Expert level Windows 10 Deployment.¬† Johan and Mikael killed this talk, as expected!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9HGSVEaqQk

Ask the experts, Windows 10 Deployment.¬† This was one of those 'deeper word' sessions.¬† A super, real-world deep dive into how the hell we're supposed to OSD upgrade all of our machines twice a year.

Chris Jackson - Deep dive on Win 10 Fall Update Security Internals

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fsVX6ULKjM

Your attacker thinks like my attacker, an awesome security minded session

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijz7NHF3l28

Red Teaming Windows

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CClpjtgaJVI

I love these business & personal growth style sessions.¬† Jeffrey had a great one here which covered staying relevant and providing value as keys to always remaining hirable.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVWjX6LYSZY

Moving 65,000 Microsofties to DevOps, definitely going to be helpful for me in my new role here!

Securing your data at rest, which had some good info I need.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U51E9Z2hajw&list=PLQXpv\_NQsPIApKVqnW7nfefvBQebIxAW7

Coding at 88MPH, a session full of tricks and tips for working in Visual Studio.¬† The keyboard shortcuts alone were worth the price of entry.

### Conference Feedback

It's important to categorize and honestly think through takeaways for a conference like this one.¬† Here are my thoughts.

#### Venue

I really liked the venue, but my favorite aspect of it is how close it is to great after hours entertainment and hotels.¬† A huge jump from Atlanta (ironically, my home city).¬† ¬†Speaking of Hotels, I was placed in the wonderful Orlando Renaissance at Seawold, a beautiful property with stunning rooms and a lovely pool (that my children made use of!)

The architecture was cool and inspiring and I liked the huge outdoor bridges connecting the venues while keeping us up and out of traffic.¬† I also am relatively young and in shape with brand new nice running shoes.¬† Many people might not have liked the tremendous amount of walking involved in this venue, so I would understand the negative feedback I'm hearing there.¬† Additionally, the walk on the bridge could be sweltering!

I didn't mind though, I was freezing my butt off in every session, so I welcomed the sun's warm embrace.

### Food and Snacks

I heard a lot of complaining about this but I eat a LOT of vegatarian food anyway, so I'm accustomed to eating cardboard.¬† Actually, I thought the veggie options were very good.¬† We could have used more fresh fruit and veggies though.

The afternoon snacks were pretty good, with nice variation of snacks.¬† The expo floor could have used more water stations.¬† I found myself leaving the expo for water, which was odd to have to do.

I loved the pop-up coffee stations around the show floor.¬† I developed a two-a-day nitro iced coffee habit.

### Session Quality and Topics

This part is challenging.¬† It was, frankly, shocking that at a conference in which we celebrated the 25th anniversary of SCCM, there were only two ConfigMgr sessions! One was '[Whats new in SCCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCNtofxOxmQ)', the other was '[System Center, what's coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCFPSE8TRiI)' (in which we learned that Orchestrator and SMA are effectively dead :(¬† )

Sure, it's not a new product anymore, but the only sessions to truly feature ConfigMgr were ones showcasing add-ons to the product, in the case of Adaptiva and 1E.¬† I really appreciate what these companies have done for the community, but a drought in content like this has me a bit worried.

This leads me to my main concern.¬† If you're a seasoned expert, you might find two or three 'deeper word' sessions worthy of attending, like [Deploying Windows 10 in the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pekf96vzBtU).¬† It feels like the session catalog was heavy on business decision maker, 200 and 300 level content.

If you're a beginner, good luck.¬† If you're an expert, I dunno, talk to the dev team in the booths.

Do you think I'm approaching this from the wrong angle?¬† Should a conference like this have a beginners track for lucky newbies to get hands on learning?¬† Is it meant to be mostly messaging from the sponsors?¬† Is it really all about swag?
