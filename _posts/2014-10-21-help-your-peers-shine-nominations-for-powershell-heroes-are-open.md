Do you know someone who has been helping the community, active on the forums, or otherwise kicking PowerShell butt and hasn't been nominated for an MVP or other award?

PowerShell.org is rolling out their second round of nominations for PowerShell heroes.  Big congrats to Mark Schill and Francois Xavier Cat, both of whom I've spoken with and are well known around PowerShell circles!

Nominations are availble here: http://powershell.org/wp/2014/10/07/accepting-nominations-for-2015-powershell-heroes/
