Hi guys,

I saw a few forum threads about this and as I just figured it out for myself, thought I would post about it.

To add an about me or other static page to your blog/site, logon to the configuration UI at [http://your\_site.wordpress.com/wp-admin](http://your_site.wordpress.com/wp-admin).

Now, click on the Appearances, then Menu buttons on the left side of the screen.

In this page you will see a list of pages on the left hand side, from here you can add and remove pages and content from the various menus on your sites.

Check the box next to the page you would like to add to your menu bar, then click 'Add to Menu'.  You may also consider checking the Menu settings box for 'Auto add Pages' which will automatically add new top-level pages to your menu bar.

If your theme allows for numerous menus, you can choose where to place the menu based on the theme's options.

Now, click Save Menu and then refresh your page.  You should see a fully functional menu bar with a link to your Static Content.

Easy, wasn't it?

I hope this saved everyone some time!
