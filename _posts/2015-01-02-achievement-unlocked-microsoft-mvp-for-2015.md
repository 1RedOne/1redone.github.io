Wow, talk about feeling blown away.  Back in September I received an e-mail stating that I'd been nominated to become an MVP, and since that moment I've felt that I've been walking on air.

I had a few career goals over my lifetime, from becoming a consultant and earning my MCSE, to eventually becoming a technical writer and trainer, and possibly even being as bold as to strive to become an MVP.  I never in my wildest dreams thought that it might happen to me!

Since I heard about the nomination back in September I'd had this cautiously optimistic feeling about it, not wanting to tell anyone but my wife, parents and a trusted few for fear of somehow spoiling it.  I knew there'd be a fierce vetting process to go through, and had heard that I'd have to provide hard numbers to back up the various things I've done in the community, so I knew I had my work cut out for me.

When I found out in early December that I would get the news on January 1st, I knew that this would be in the back of my mind through the whole holiday season.  I made sure I didn't let it consume me, but I will admit to being so excited on New Year's Eve that I practically couldnt sleep.  Getting a fever and a cold didn't help things either!

# So much F5-ing on Twitter

On New Year's Day,  My wife and I were nursing colds trying to keep from getting our ChildItem from getting sick too, enjoying Theraflu and hot chocolate and winding down from the Holidays.

I should mention that I was also checking my Twitter constantly.  I saw my PowerShell friends overseas writing about their awards, the venerable folks in the Asia region talking about theirs.  I even saw a blog post on the SE Asia MVP site saying that all notices had been sent, congrats to the winners.  While I watched, Jan Egil Ring got his award, and then many others, and I felt my hopes rise, then fall as the tweets died out.  Someone mentioned that they got their notice at 8:30 AM in their local time, so I started thinking maybe it didn't happen.

My wife told me I was letting it get to me and that I should just turn my ringer on and leave the phone in the bedroom and help her get the house straightened up (she was right, we were taking down the Christmas tree and there I stood unmoving for a few moments with Christmas lights and tinsel held in one hand and my phone in the other, furiously refreshing my GMail!)  I agreed and left my phone as she recommended.

We went back to playing with our daughter and taking down the Christmas decorations, as we played one last Pandora Christmas Playlist and had our cocoa, and tried to put feelings of disappointment aside.

Thirty minutes later, we heard the special ringer I set for Gmail messages containing the words 'MVP' go off!  I practically sprinted across the house to grab my phone!  I virtually slid from the door of the bedroom over to the bedside table, I don't think my feet even touched the ground!  I snatched my phone up, fogetting my phone unlock code over and over in my haste.  When I finally controlled my thumbs again, I  saw the headline of the message

And we started dancing!  Our colds forgotten, we danced around the room and then went out to celebrate at the steak house!  We were on top of the world while we were out, spirits high and our minds clouded with robitussin...and then...our flu medicine wore off.  So what if I feel asleep in my mashed potatoes, woo-hoo!  A little bit of _aus jus_ in my hair is a small price to pay!

## Thank you every one!

I want to thank the person who nominated me, the folks who've read my blog, my family and coworkers for tolerating me talking about it relentlessly, and the incredible PowerShell community.  I may be prejudiced, but I swear that I've met some of the best people I know through my PowerShell and System Center connection to my peers in the Atlanta area.

Thank you all, I am very honored and deeply humbled to be chosen, and will strive to work ever harder for you all in this New Year!
