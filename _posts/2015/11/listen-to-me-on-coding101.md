Last week, I had an amazing time at the Microsoft MVP Summit, it was a dream come true!  Speaking of true, I even got to meet Jim Truher and Bruce Payette!  Simply a wonderful, wonderful time.

Probably my favorite part about being there was getting to be on a live podcast recording for TWiT network's Coding 101 show, along with [Sarah Dutkiewicz](https://twitter.com/sadukie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Adam Bertram](https://twitter.com/adbertram?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Jeremy Clark](https://twitter.com/jeremybytes), [June Blender](https://twitter.com/juneb_get_help), & [Jeff Wouters](https://twitter.com/JeffWouters?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)!  We got to talk about what got us into coding, how to become an MVP, and our favorite (and worst) interview questions.  I feel like I did pretty well, despite my heart trying to pound out of my chest.

Let me know how you think I did!

If you're reading this, you're sneaky!  I've got something really cool coming down the pipe about how to use Appveyor and Pester, so keep checking in!
