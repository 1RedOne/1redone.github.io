![](../assets/images/2013/12/images/slowest-ever.png) I was wrong earlier.

Yep, this is now the slowest ever transfer. I was uploading the contents of a Server2012\\Install\\Sources\\SXS folder to another server in Switzerland. Such Speed!

Just to be clear, this was the fourth attempt to complete this transfer, at a scorching speed of 3 KBPS!!
