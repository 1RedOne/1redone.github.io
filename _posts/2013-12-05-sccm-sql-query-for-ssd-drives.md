Recently at a client, a need arose to provide a report listing whether a workstation had an SSD or a spinning disk.

Unfortunately, Windows does not concern itself with noting whether or not a disk is spinning or solid state, and thus the information is not in the registry or WMI for us to collect with SCCM.

However, most manufacturers stick to a naming convention, and with a little bit of elbow grease, you can expand this to work in your environment too. Â In this format, you'll get 'Known SSD Drive' if the drive model or naming is captured in the CASE filter of query, or the drive model if not.
