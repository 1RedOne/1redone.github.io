Hi guys!  I'm still alive, I promise!

Recently I've gone a bit of a blog and twitter hiatus, because the FoxDeploy family just instantiated a new child-object!  Born February 2nd at 2:02 AM, I had my first son!

I promise I've got some nice posts on the way, including the anticipated Part V of my GUI series, as well as Part V of the DSC guide...including a new tool I've been working on with some help from my friends in Redmond...

See, I even wrote this post with a baby on me :)
