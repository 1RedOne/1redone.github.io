Hi guys,

A few weeks ago, our team--The Kitten Mittons--had the honor of being on the PowerShell.org PowerScripting podcast to talk about PowerShell and our experiences competing in and winning the 2014 Winter Scripting games.  My team mates, including Jason Morgan and Julie Andreacola, are incredibly sharp, and teaming up with them was such a great experience.

You can listen to us here: http://powershell.org/wp/2014/06/15/episode-273-powerscripting-podcast-the-scripting-games-team-winners/

Tune in later this week, I'm about to release a guide on how you should, and how you shouldn't attempt to add -WhatIf support to your scripts.
