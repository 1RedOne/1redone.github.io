## Going on air!

Hi readers, I'm very pleased to announce that the Kitten Mittons are currently scheduled to be featured on the very popular PowerShell Power Scripting podcast, which airs every Wednesday night at 9:30 Eastern Standard Time. Â If you've got a question for the team about our experiences in the Winter Scripting Games, please sign on and ask away in the chat room. Thanks!
