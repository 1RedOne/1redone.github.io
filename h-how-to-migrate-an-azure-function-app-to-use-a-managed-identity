excerpt: "Recently I came upon the need to harden how some Azure Functions were setup.  Specifically, they were Azure Functions setup to fire and run some c# code when a message was dropped into a message queue.  They worked great, but we would much rather use the security of a Managed Identity to connect, instead using of using a connection string."
