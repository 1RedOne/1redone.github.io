I have really loved these last three years with #BigBank #SpoilersItWasWellsFargoAllAlong and made some great friends and had some awesome experiences creating and sharing sessions at MMS with my friends I made along the way.

My career for the last ten years has been focused on automating, deploying, and managing Microsoft technologies. And now now, I'm going to get a chance to help work on them as well!

Starting May 18th, I am happily joining Microsoft's Azure Compute team as a Developer. I'll be remaining in Atlanta, and working from home for the foreseeable future.

What to Expect

This blog has always been a place for me to show you how I do it and I will continue to do the same thing, with my own same flavor and perspective. All thoughts and perspectives will be my own and will not be my employers.

I'll update this blog in the coming weeks when I have tips to share about what I've been working on, or as post ideas strike me!
