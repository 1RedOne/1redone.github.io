Hi! I work for Microsoft as a full-stack dev for Azure out of Atlanta.  

My focus is on distributed high performance web systems, with an emphasis on end-to-end testing, security, CICD and release automation. I love writing products people will really use.  

Previously, I was an original member of the dev team for Azure Automanage. Now, I’m a Senior Engineer for Azure Machine Configuration—and…stay tuned for more.  

My work-life passions are product and service reliability and improvements, monitoring, metrics, and COGs optimization. When I am on your team, the on-call experience will get better and better!  

I wasn’t always a dev though, only pivoting since around 2013. Before that I had a full career as a Microsoft Enterprise Configuration Management Consultant with a focus on enterprise client management through System Center and automation. At the time, I specialized in PowerShell tool-making, process automation, MDM, modern workplace, and systems management.  

I’m also a seasoned speaker, delivering sessions at user groups and conferences in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and NYC. I’ve spoken at MMS and Microsoft Ignite as well.  

For hobbies, I enjoy Yu-Gi-Oh!, Balatro, adventuring with my family, and programming for fun.  

Let’s jam.
