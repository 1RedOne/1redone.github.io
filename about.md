## Whatâ€™s up with the name?
I get this, from time to time.  A lot of the time, in fact! And no, its not a â€˜what does the fox sayâ€™ thing.  Sorry, if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re into. ðŸ™‚

Why FoxDeploy?  Well, I spent more than a year trying to come up with a name for a blog, initally!

I was inspired by a coworker of mineâ€™s blog;  Jeff Renfroeâ€™s terrific [Deploy OS.com](http://www.deployos.com) which Iâ€™ve come to time and time again to solve issues I encounter with SCCM.  And I knew that I wanted to write about interesting situations that come up as one grows and learns about Enterprise Client Management and Operating System Deployment.  So thatâ€™s where the â€˜deployâ€™ part came from.

But the foxes?  Well, from a young age, the Fox has always been my favorite animal.  Respected in cultures around the world, and particularly so in one of my favorite places the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, Japan (picture below in a shot that I took).   In Japan, the fox is a trixster, able to appear in human form and usually granting a benevolent gift of business fortune on those who pay it respect.

I like to think of myself as something of a wry trixster too, and hence the name was a natural fit.
