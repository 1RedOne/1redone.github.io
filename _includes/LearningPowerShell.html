		<p>I’ll be fleshing this section out as the weeks go on with some of my favorite PowerShell and System Center Resources.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>My first exposure to PowerShell was during a competitive job interview. Head to head with another hopeful admin to be, both competing in a language we’d never used before: PowerShell!</p>
<p>They handed us a guide, and gave a list of tasks. This was the guide</p>
<p>Don Jones’ ‘<a href="http://windowsitpro.com/blog/dons-188-minute-powershell-crash-course-you-can-learn">18.8 Minute PowerShell crash course</a>‘ –</p>
<p>My next exposure after my initial appetite was fanned was through his excellent <a href="http://amzn.to/ZndQAH">Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches</a> book, now in it’s third version! My own has dozens and dozens of tabs in it. I love this book, because I was able to pick it up, read a chapter and then by the end of my lunch, have learned something interesting, useful and new every day. Because the examples grew in complexity, I was constantly going back and upgrading my old scripts when I picked up new tips.</p>
<p>Been reading a lot of materials from the community, participating in scripting games and on forums like Reddit, Microsoft and PowerShell.org.</p>
<p>My new favorite book is Windows PowerShell in Action, by Bruce Payett. Awesome book, gives you a behind the scenes into how PowerShell was made, what the challenges were and how they dealt with ideas from other languages. Very very good source for some deep dive info.</p>
