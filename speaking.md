Work from this blog has been featured in The DSC Book, by Don Jones and Stephen Murawski.

He was fortunate enough to be a member of the winning team of the 2014 PowerShell Scripting games, the Kitten Mittons.  The team was  featured in an interview on the PowerShell.org PowerScripting podcast on June 4th, 2014.  The download link is available here.

On November 2015, he was featured on an interview with Father Robert Ballacer on the Coding 101 Podcast titled â€“ Best of the MVP Summit, alongside the stellar Sarah Dutkiewicz, Adam Bertram, Jeremy Clark, June Blender,& Jeff Wouters. 

In September of 2016, Stephen was thrilled to be invited to deliver a number of sessions at Microsoft Ignite in his hometown, Atlanta Georgia. He somehow managed to do this without his pants falling off.
